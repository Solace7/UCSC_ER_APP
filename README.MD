University of California Santa Cruz has a website that lists jobs that students can apply for
Out of both boredem and a want for a small project I decided to write a script in python that could scrape the website
and export it to a json, that I could diff via crontab, and if there's a new job send myself an email.

I may or may not turn this into an app for android.

We'll see.
